    "# Python Open-Ended Coding Questions for Beginners (Syntax, Types, and `__main__`)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Syntax\n",
    "- **Write a script that demonstrates how to use single quotes (`'`), double quotes (`\"`), and triple quotes (`'''` or `\"\"\"`) to create strings, including examples of text with special characters like quotes or newlines.**\n",
    "  - For example, create strings like \"I said 'hello'\" or a multi-line poem using triple quotes. Show how to include a backslash (`\\`) to escape special characters, like a quote inside a string. Explain what each type of quote does and why you might choose one over another.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a simple program that uses the `pass` statement in at least two different places, such as an empty function or an empty block, and describe why it’s used.**\n",
    "  - For instance, write a function that’s meant to calculate something but isn’t ready yet, or an if-statement with no action. Include comments explaining why `pass` is there and how it acts as a placeholder for future code.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a program that shows how to create valid and invalid variable names, and explain the rules for naming variables in Python.**\n",
    "  - Create variables like `my_name`, `age2`, and try invalid ones like `2age` or `my-name`. Show what happens when you use a Python keyword like `if` as a variable name. Include comments explaining why some names work and others cause errors.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a script that uses comments with `#` to explain what the code does, and demonstrate both single-line and multi-line comments using triple quotes.**\n",
    "  - For example, write a simple script that assigns a few variables and uses `#` to describe each step. Then use triple quotes to write a multi-line comment at the top of the script explaining its purpose. Show how comments help make code readable for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a program that uses the semicolon (`;`) to write multiple statements on a single line, and explain why this is rarely used in Python.**\n",
    "  - For instance, write `x = 5; y = 10; print(x + y)` on one line. Include comments explaining that Python prefers one statement per line for readability, and show how the same code looks without semicolons.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Types\n",
    "- **Write a program that creates and prints variables of type `int`, `float`, and `complex`, and shows basic math operations with each.**\n",
    "  - Create variables like `age = 25`, `height = 5.8`, and `complex_num = 3 + 4j`. Perform operations like addition or multiplication, and print the results. Use `type()` to show each variable’s type and include comments explaining what `int`, `float`, and `complex` mean.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a script that demonstrates the `bool` type by testing different values (like numbers, strings, or empty lists) in if-statements to see if they are `True` or `False`.**\n",
    "  - For example, test `if 0:`, `if \"hello\":`, or `if []:`. Print whether each value is treated as `True` or `False`. Include comments explaining why Python considers some values like `0` or empty lists as `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a program that uses `None` to represent missing or empty data, and show how it’s different from `0` or an empty string.**\n",
    "  - Create variables like `name = None`, `score = 0`, and `text = \"\"`. Print them and use `type()` to show `None` is a `NoneType`. Include comments explaining when you might use `None`, like for a variable that hasn’t been assigned a value yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a script that works with strings (`str`) and shows how to combine them, find their length, and use basic string methods like `upper()` or `lower()`.**\n",
    "  - For example, create strings like `greeting = \"Hello\"` and `name = \"Alice\"`, combine them with `+`, and use methods like `greeting.upper()` or `name.lower()`. Print the length with `len()`. Include comments explaining what strings are and how these methods change them.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a program that creates a `list` and a `tuple` with the same items, and demonstrates how to access elements and try modifying them.**\n",
    "  - Create `my_list = [1, 2, 3]` and `my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)`. Access elements with `my_list[0]` and try changing `my_list[0] = 4` and `my_tuple[0] = 4`. Show the error for the tuple and explain in comments why lists are mutable but tuples are not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a dictionary (`dict`) to store information like a student’s name and grades, and show how to add, access, and remove items.**\n",
    "  - For example, create `student = {\"name\": \"Bob\", \"grade\": 85}`. Add a new key-value pair, access `student[\"name\"]`, and remove a key with `del`. Include comments explaining how dictionaries use keys and why they must be unique.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a script that creates a `set` and a `frozenset` from a list with duplicates, and shows how to add or remove items from the `set`.**\n",
    "  - Create `my_list = [1, 2, 2, 3]`, then `my_set = set(my_list)` and `frozen = frozenset(my_list)`. Add an item to `my_set` with `add()` and try it on `frozenset` (show the error). Include comments explaining how sets remove duplicates and why `frozenset` is immutable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a program that converts between types, like turning a string into an integer or a float into a string, and handles errors if the conversion fails.**\n",
    "  - For example, convert `\"123\"` to an `int` with `int(\"123\")` and `3.14` to a string with `str(3.14)`. Try converting `\"abc\"` to an `int` and use a `try-except` to catch the error. Include comments explaining what type conversion is and why errors happen.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a script that uses f-strings to format a message with variables, and compare it to using the `+` operator to combine strings.**\n",
    "  - For example, use `name = \"Alice\"` and `age = 10` to create `f\"{name} is {age} years old\"` and `\"Name: \" + name + \", Age: \" + str(age)`. Print both and include comments explaining why f-strings are easier and cleaner for beginners.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a program that uses string slicing to extract parts of a string, like the first three characters or every other character.**\n",
    "  - Create a string like `text = \"Python\"`. Use `text[0:3]` to get \"Pyt\" and `text[::2]` to get \"Pto\". Include comments explaining how slicing works with `start:end:step` and what each part does.\n",
    "\n",
    "## `__main__` Method\n",
    "- **Write a simple script that uses `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to print a message when run directly, but not when imported into another script.**\n",
    "  - Create a script with a message like `print(\"Running directly!\")` inside `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`. Make another script that imports it and show it doesn’t print. Include comments explaining what `__name__` is and why this check is useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Create a program with a function that adds two numbers, and call it only if the script is run directly using `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`.**\n",
    "  - Write a function like `def add(a, b): return a + b`. Inside `if __name__ == \"__main__\":`, call `add(3, 4)` and print the result. Include comments explaining how this keeps the function reusable without running automatically when imported.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Write a script that uses `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` to set variables and print them, showing it can hold any code, not just functions.**\n",
    "  - For example, set `x = 5` and `y = \"Hello\"` inside `if __name__ == \"__main__\":` and print them. Include comments explaining that this block can contain any code, like loops or calculations, and only runs when the script is executed directly.\n"
